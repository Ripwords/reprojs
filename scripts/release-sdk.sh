# Bumps packages/core's version, runs prerelease checks, writes
# packages/core/CHANGELOG.md, commits, and tags as sdk-vX.Y.Z. The tag push
# triggers .github/workflows/publish-npm.yml, which republishes @reprojs/core
# from source with provenance and creates the GitHub Release.
#
# Usage:
#   bun run release:sdk [patch|minor|major]
#
# The SDK release is intentionally decoupled from the dashboard release
# (which uses `bun run release:minor` and v*.*.* tags), so a dashboard-only
# change doesn't force a churn republish of the SDK.
#
# Why delegate to changelogen instead of bumping package.json in the shell:
#   - Generates packages/core/CHANGELOG.md so the npm-side release line has
#     its own changelog, independent of the dashboard's root CHANGELOG.md.
#   - Produces the release notes that publish-npm.yml pastes into the GH
#     Release, so consumers get a real changelog on every tag.
