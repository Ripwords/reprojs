# Bumps packages/expo's version, runs prerelease checks, writes
# packages/expo/CHANGELOG.md, commits, and tags as expo-vX.Y.Z. The tag push
# triggers .github/workflows/publish-expo.yml, which republishes @reprojs/expo
# from source with provenance and creates the GitHub Release.
#
# Usage:
#   bun run release:expo [patch|minor|major]
#
# The Expo SDK is on its own release line separate from @reprojs/core (sdk-v*)
# and the dashboard (v*). Breaking changes in one don't force churn in the
# others.
#
# Bootstrap: before the very first release, `expo-v0.0.0` must exist as a
# base for changelogen's --from range. Cut it with:
#
#   git tag expo-v0.0.0 $(git rev-list --max-parents=0 HEAD)
#   git push origin expo-v0.0.0
#
# …then run this script.
