 *   - Non-empty allow-list → must contain the origin exactly.
 *   - Empty allow-list in development → localhost / 127.0.0.1 passes
 *     (so first-time local SDK testing doesn't require config).
 *   - Empty allow-list in production → always reject. Operators must
 *     set `allowedOrigins` on each project before it can receive
