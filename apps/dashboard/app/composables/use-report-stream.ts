//
// Client-side subscription to the per-report SSE endpoint. Uses VueUse's
// `useEventSource`, which is the Nuxt-documented GET-based SSE consumer
// (https://nuxt.com/docs/4.x/getting-started/data-fetching#consuming-sse-server-sent-events-via-post-request).
//
// The server stamps every frame with a unique nonce — without that, two
// back-to-back frames with identical kind+payload would serialise to the
// same string, and Vue's `watch(data)` does a strict-equality check which
// would coalesce them into a single handler call. The nonce guarantees every
// frame bumps the ref and triggers the watcher.
//
// Memory-safety: `useEventSource` closes the underlying connection on the
// component's setup scope disposal. We layer an explicit `onBeforeUnmount`
// close() on top as a belt-and-suspenders, plus the watcher stops with the
// setup scope automatically.
//
// Reconnect: `useEventSource`'s `autoReconnect` caps retries so we don't
// burn battery on mobile during prolonged outages.
